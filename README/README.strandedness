I believe for Illumina Tru-seq stranded protocol you need to use the 4th column.
However, the general rule is to compare the total counts over genes in the 3rd and 4th column, and select the column which has much larger total counts.
If the counts in two columns are not very different, the protocol is unstranded and you need to use the 2nd column.
Yet even an easier method is to look at the N_noFeature line for the 3rd and 4th column and pick the column with the lowest count.

Simply put, pick strandMode=1 if column 3 greatest (or N_noFeature lowest) and strandMode=2 if column 4 greatest (or N_noFeature lowest)
