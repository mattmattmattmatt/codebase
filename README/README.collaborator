A.caninum reference used-
  assembly fasta: Reference/ancylostoma_caninum.PRJNA72585.WBPS8.genomic.fa
  annotation:     Reference/ancylostoma_caninum.PRJNA72585.WBPS8.annotations.gff3


METHOD:
=======
1) The 21 unique ESTs were mapped against our A.caninum reference (PRJNA72585) using the
   HiSat2 aligner and the results were used to identify the A.caninum genes associated 
   with each EST.  15 of these mapped into gene regions.

2) High quality 'Reads of Insert' (RoI) data was extracted from 6 SMRT cells worth of 
   A.caninum transcript PacBio data using settings requiring each insert to be spanned
   >= 2x and with an accuracy of 99%.

3) The RoI reads were mapped against the A.caninum reference also using HiSat2.  Lists of
   RoI reads mapping into the gene models for each identified gene were generated using 
   samtools.

4) For each unique EST mapping to an annotated A.caninum gene a fastq file was generated 
   to contain all the PacBio RoI reads mapping to that gene.


NOTES:
======
-- The EST 'gi|158005927|gb|EX552545.1|' appears twice in the original table we were given,
   so while there are 22 rows in the provided table, they represent only 21 unique sequences.

-- 15 of the 21 unique ESTs mapped into A.caninum genes.

-- No minimum overlap was required for RoI reads mapping into the identified genes.  Any RoI
   that 'touched' a gene (by even a single base) in its alignment was included in the fastq
   for that EST.

-- HiSat2 is a splice aware alignment tool, suitable for mapping transcript data against
   genomic references.  Default arguments were used for the alignment.

-- The A.caninum reference & annotation used in this analysis (PRJNA72585) was downloaded
   from WormBase Parasite:
