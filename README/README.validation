1) Optimise two cutoff parameters by determining balance between number of reads to make UID group and number of UID groups required.

>cd ~/work/anu/jurkat_stats/validation
>for f in *.txt; do perl -ne '@cols = split /\s/; print if $cols[6] >= 2 && $cols[5]/$cols[6] >= 0.8' $f > $f.min2reads; done





2) Using PBMC_all check how well these variants track through the dilutions. We would expect most to present at all dilutions. Perform this for all variants and dbsnp variants.

3) Identify SNVs in Jurkat and not in PBMC and see how well these track through the dilutions.  Perform this for all variants, dbsnp variants, and jurkat somatic variants.

4) Validation: Devise smart way to validate results of very rare variants.  I think the idea we settled on was using variant(s) expected to be present in certain cell types that are a small fraction of total cells so we can isolate the cell type and reduce the number of sequences required to validate. 

5) When Peter has results compare with my results.

6) See how I can make annotation code available for Manu.
