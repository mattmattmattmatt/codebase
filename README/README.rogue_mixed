From Manu:

They are all DNA-targeted capture. No need for any pairing or combining any samples at this stage – the 2 memory and 2 rogue are the previous rogue samples but have gone through a new capture panel and the ‘3 rogue 2’ samples are single rogue cells from a different patient (Rogue 2). If you could treat them all individually for now that would be great.
