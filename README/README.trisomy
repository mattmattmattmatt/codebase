In two of the attached papers they show that trisomy for chromosome 3 occurs in more than 50% of salivary gland MALT lymphomas, which typically evolve from rheumatoid-factor producing cells in Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome patients. This may be the most common cytogenetic abnormality, so reasonable to ask if it has already risen in rogue one.

Could we test for trisomy 3 in rogue 1 by the following?

    Identify all common rs SNPs that appear to be heterozygous in normal memory B cell pool.
    Test for consistent distortion of the reads for these SNPs from the expected 50:50 allelic ratio.
